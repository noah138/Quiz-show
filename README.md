# Module 4 Challenge

# Monkey Quiz

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a timed quiz that stored high scores. When the quiz is started, the user is presented with a question and four options to choose from. With each correct answer the user's score increments by 10 and with every wrong answer the user's score decrements by 2. Further, a 30 second timer begins when the quiz is started, and decrements by 5 seconds with each wrong answer. When there is no more time remaining or questions left, the quiz ends. The user can then submit their score along with their name to the high scores list. This list will be saved until cleared.
